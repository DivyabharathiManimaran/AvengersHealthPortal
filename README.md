<h3>Mission and vision</h3>
<p>The story behind the construction of this portal is to facilitate his Medical team to access the health history, allergies, syndromes, etc., of each avenger, thereby enabling the provision of proper medications during an emergency.As a stepping stone to this mission, I developed a simple yet attractive and responsive web application where the Medical team can access the member's information. This is a prototype that can be used for demo purposes and is called by the name "Avengers Health Portal" (AHP).</p>
